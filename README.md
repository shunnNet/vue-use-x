# vue-use-x
This is an unofficial, reusable Vue 3 utility library, which includes many personal preferences. 

Unlike [`vueuse`](https://vueuse.org/), `vue-use-x` is split into several modules, such as `modal`, `query`, `common`. These modules are typically designed to help handle specific development scenarios, making them less painful to work with. In addition, it also offers some small, generic composables. In principle, this package does not provide composables that are already available in `vueuse`.
